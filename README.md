# Tic-Tac-Toe
After completing Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree ,I decided to build a single-page tic-tac-toe game to further enhance the knowledeg I received.
It is a 2-player game with user inerface that allows each player fill up cell with each turn with "X" always being player one. 
For each game session, a record of X wins, O wins and Ties are recorded. Clicking the reset Button sets all back to zero.
This project is build using Html, Css, Js and Jquery.
